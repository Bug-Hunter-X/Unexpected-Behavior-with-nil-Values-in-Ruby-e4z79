This repository demonstrates a common, yet often subtle, issue in Ruby code: the unexpected behavior that can arise from the use of `nil` values. While `nil` is a valid value in Ruby, it can lead to problems if not handled carefully.  The example code shows how `nil` can result in runtime errors or unexpected results if not explicitly checked for or handled. The solution provides safer approaches to handle cases where `nil` might occur.
